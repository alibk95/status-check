Simple parser to let me know whether my document is ready to collect.

I used BeautifulSoup library to parse the html. <br> 
It is installable following the command below: <br>
```sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4```

I use it simply by adding it to my aliases on linux cl.<br>
```alias per="python3 path/to/script/main.py"``` <br>
This lets me to type "per" and the script starts to run and shows the result.
